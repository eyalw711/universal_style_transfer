\hspace{0.5cm} This project deals with the paper of Universal Style Transfer via Feature Transforms \cite{bib11}. Its main goals are to implement the proposed algorithm in PyTorch, and to add innovations in its capabilities. The code for our implementation is in the repository \url{https://github.com/eyalw711/universal_style_transfer}. Our innovations include a new \textit{boosting} technique to enhance the style transfer effect, and three new merging to techniques to transfer style from two images simultaneously. This section describes the methods in which we tackled the following tasks: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Building and training the models required for Universal Style Transfer via Feature Transforms as described in \cite{bib11}.
	\item Implementing a PyTorch program to perform the UST algorithm as described in \cite{bib11}.
	\item Present innovative method to enhance the style transfer effect. This method shall be referred to as \textit{Boosting}.
	\item In \cite{bib11}, Li et al. present a method to transfer style from a pair of style images, in such a way that the result will contain stylistic aspects of both. Let's refer to this problem as \textit{Merge}-UST. In this task we research methods that utilize the UST framework to perform Merge-UST in a computationally lighter fashion than the original.
